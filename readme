Neural Net Report

My main interest is in autonomous driving, but I chose the Neural Net challenge
  since I'm not too well-versed with deep learning so I thought this'd be a
  good opportunity to really learn how neural nets work.

I implemented a pretty basic neural net in C++ using the Eigen library, with
  a quadratic cost function. The neural net classifies the Iris data-set with
  98% accuracy with the hyperparameters I chose.

I implemented 2 classes; a Network class for the neural net, and a Iris_Loader
  class to load the dataset in.

The results are shown in the 2 images, cost.png and correct.png. There are
  definitely more elegant methods of data visualization, but I ran out of 
  time so here goes.

To run:

  1. Edit ./src/Makefile so that the path to the Eigen library is set correctly
       if it isn't already
  2. Run Makefile:

    cd src
    make
    chmod u+x test
    ./test
